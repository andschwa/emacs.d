# My emacs settings
> A vim user's forray into uncharted territory.

I've tried prelude and spacemacs before but it's like using Janus for Vim... You need to get down and dirty with the editor to really understand what's going on.

This is my attempt to start using Emacs without any preconfigured settings. I'm starting from sratch and adding things as I learn.

Feel free to ping me if you see something that's horribly wrong or I should look into.


## What's been added so far:
- [Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) for dependency management.
- [Evil](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil) vi for emacs.
